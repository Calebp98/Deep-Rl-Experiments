# Intial Experiments in Deep Reinforcement Learning

My implementation of deep RL algorithms to solve a simplified game of chess. The implementation folder contains an
implementation of Q-learning and SARSA using normal backpropagation and RMSprop with the RELU activation function. A report 
has also been written comparing these algorithms.
